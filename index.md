## About me

I am a high energy particle physics experimentalist at Fermilab.  I am interested in understanding the basic building blocks of the universe using particle accelerators to smash particles together and study these collisions in the laboratory.  I am a member of the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and was extremely fortunate to be a part of the Higgs discovery.  My most recent activities involve study of the Higgs boson, searches for phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and understanding nature of dark matter.
